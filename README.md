The Time Keeper is a clock that utilizes a Real Time Clock ( RTC) connected to an Arduino Uno to tell the time. There are three different NeoPixel strips that each display seconds, minutes, and hours respectively. When it is day time, the lights are warm colors (red, orange, yellow) and when it is night time, the colors are cool (blue and purple). Because of the RTC, The Time Keeper only needs to be plugged into a power source to work.
